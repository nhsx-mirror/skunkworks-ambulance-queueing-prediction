## Overview and Purpose
This directory contains a file called `preprocessing.py`. The purpose of `preprocessing.py` is to carry out the data manipulations that are required for the smooth running of the model. The script uses the raw datasets (or the fake data generated by using the `fake_data_generator.py` script) to generate the features that are then fed into the model.

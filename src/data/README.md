# Generating Fake Data

## Overview

This directory contains` generate_fake_data.py` and `acquisiton.py`. The purpose of `generate_fake_data.py` is to create `.parquet` files with three fake data sets.

The purpose of the fake data is to be used as an example of how the data needs to be formatted in order to be inputted into the model. It should be noted that the outputs of the model using the fake data are unrealistic and should not be used to test the performance of the model.

The data is generated completely randomly. 

`acquisition.py` contains functions to enrich the fake data with additional datasets. Please note that this scrip uses the `bank_holiday_data_1953_to_1954.csv` which lists all of the bank holidays in those years. This is purely for example purposes and if the model were to be ran on other data, this would need to be updated.

## How to Run

Before running ensure your environment is set up as described in: 

The fake data can be generated by following the example in the `01-generate-fake-data.ipynb` notebook.

Alternatively, the notebook can be ran automatically using the following command lines.
Please note all bash commands listed below assume the working directory is `skunkworks-ambulance-queueing-prediction/notebooks`

`jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute 01-fake-data-generation.ipynb --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3`

This will save the three fake datasets in the `\outputs` directory.
